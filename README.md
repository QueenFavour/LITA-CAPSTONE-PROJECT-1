### PROJECT OVERVIEW 
Analyzing the sales performance of incubator Hub retail store and the need to explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional 
performance, and monthly sales trend using Data analysis tools such as Excel for creating pivot tables, SQL for data exploration and to produce an interactive Power BI 
dashboard that highlights these findings.
### PROJECT OBJECTIVES
- To uncover key insights such as Top selling products and Regions
- To explore sales data using Pivot tables in Excel
- To analyze various sales trend in Incubator Hub retail store database in SQL 
- To clean data and create an interactive dashboard of sales data in PowerBI.
### DATA ANALYSIS TOOLS USED
Microsoft Excel [download here](https//www.microsoftexcel.com)

Microsoft SQL Server [download here](https//www.microsoft.com)

Microsoft PowerBI [download here](https//microsoft.com)
### DATA SOURCE
The Primary Data Used here is lita capstone project.xlsx for Incubator Hub retail store
### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATIONS
At the preliminary phase of the data cleaning and preparations , we performed the following actions;

i. Data loading and inspection

Data loading and inspection are crucial steps in data analysis, ensuring accuracy and reliability. In Excel, data is loaded through importing CSV or Excel files, while in SQL, data is queried from databases using SELECT statements. Once loaded, data inspection involves checking for missing values, outliers, and data types using Excel's Data Validation or SQL's summary statistics. Power BI improves data inspection through interactive visualizations, allowing users to quickly identify trends and discrepancies.

ii. Data cleaning and formatting
Excel was used in cleaning data which involves removing duplicates (using "Remove Duplicates" tool), and formatting data (using Text to Columns, Trim, and PROPER functions). Power BI was also used to  "Transform" and remove blanks, trim text, and change data types. Excel's "Data Validation" and Power BI's "Data Profiling" tools help identify inconsistencies and errors.

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
This involves exploring of the data to answer some questions such as;
- Which region recorded the highest sales revenue
- What is the sum of sales Revenue
- What is the top selling product
- What is the sum of revenue by region
